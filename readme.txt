Manage restaurant listings from the WordPress admin panel, and allow users to post restaurants directly to your site.

== Description ==

WP Restaurant Listings is a lightweight restaurant listing plugin for adding restaurant listing functionality to your WordPress site. Being shortcode based, it can work with any theme (given a bit of CSS styling) and is really simple to setup.

= Features =

* Add, manage, and categorize restaurant listings using the familiar WordPress UI.
* Searchable & filterable ajax powered restaurant listings added to your pages via shortcodes.
* Frontend forms for guests and registered users to submit & manage restaurant listings.
* Allow restaurant listers to preview their listing before it goes live. The preview matches the appearance of a live restaurant listing.
* Searches also display RSS links to allow restaurant seekers to be alerted to new restaurants matching their search.
* Allow logged in listers to view, edit, or delete their active restaurant listings.
* Developer friendly code â€” Custom Post Types & template files.

The plugin comes with several shortcodes to output restaurants in various formats, and since it's built with Custom Post Types you are free to extend it further through themes.

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WP Restaurant Listings" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.

* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Getting started =

Once installed:

1. Create a page called "restaurants" and inside place the `[restaurants]` shortcode. This will list your restaurants.
2. Create a page called "submit restaurant" and inside place the `[submit_restaurant_form]` shortcode if you want front-end submissions.
3. Create a page called "restaurant dashboard" and inside place the `[restaurant_dashboard]` shortcode for logged in users to manage their listings.

**Note when using shortcodes**, if the content looks blown up/spaced out/poorly styled, edit your page and above the visual editor click on the 'text' tab. Then remove any 'pre' or 'code' tags wrapping your shortcode.
